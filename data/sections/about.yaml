# a summary about you
summary: 'I am an engineer with 10 years of experience ranging from Network Analytics to DevOps. My favorite projects are the ones where we can see the destination, but not the path ahead, where I can flex my creative muscle to carve out a path to success. AWS certified cloud enthusiast, holding 3 associate level certifications as well as a [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) associate certification. In my free time you can find me snapping photos on my Leica Q2 or climbing the crag. Here is a random list of things I like. :)'
  
  # 'I am a passionate software engineer with x years of working experience. I built OSS tools for [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) using GO. My tools help people to deploy their workloads in Kubernetes. Sometimes, I work on some fun projects such as writing a theme, etc.'
